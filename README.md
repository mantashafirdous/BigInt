In C/C++ the number of digits a long long int can have is a maximum of 20. 
And the question is to store the 22 digit number which is not easy to store in any kind of primitive type. 
So to deal with this type of problem letâ€™s design a new data type which is going to be called BigInt.
In this project, a few basic operations are being implemented on the new data type.

Add two big integers.
Subtract two big integers
Multiply two big integers.
Divide two big integers.
Modulo two big integers
Raise a big integer to a power
The square root of a big integer
Comparison between two big integers to check which is greater and which is smaller.
Find the number of digits in the big integer.
Print the big integer.
Convert an integer to a big integer.
